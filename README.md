ted's personal site!!

made mostly for some practice with rails and css.

TODO:

1)  Improve the capistrano deploy script.  Pretty ghetto right now.  Just uploads the new code.  Kills the current unicorn process and restarts nginx.  Could be a lot smarter.
1a)  There seem to be errors with the asset pipeline that I haven't looked into at all.  Again part of deploy.
1b)  Include database update as part of the script.

2)  Try to do a real redesign of the site.  Not the minimum you have now.  Practice CSS.

3)  Try playing with some load testing.  Try moving the webserver/database to a higher tier
